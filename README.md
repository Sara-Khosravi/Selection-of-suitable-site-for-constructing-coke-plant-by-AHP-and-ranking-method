# Selection of Suitable Site for Constructing a Coke Plant by AHP and Ranking Method

## Data and Tools Utilization

This repository includes analyses and models developed as part of our project on selecting the most suitable site for constructing a coke plant. Here's how we've incorporated various sources and tools:

- **Roskill Reports**: Utilized for up-to-date market analysis and trends in the minerals and metals sectors. These reports provide critical insights into supply chain dynamics, pricing, and market forecasts.
- **UN Data**: Provides the demographic and economic datasets that underpin our socio-economic models. This data helps in understanding the population distribution, economic conditions, and infrastructure availability in potential site locations.
- **Oil Refinery Case Studies**: Employed to understand the impact of market fluctuations on operational efficiencies. These case studies offer valuable lessons on site selection criteria, environmental considerations, and logistical challenges.

The project employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and ranking methods to evaluate and rank potential sites based on a comprehensive set of economic, environmental, and logistical criteria.
